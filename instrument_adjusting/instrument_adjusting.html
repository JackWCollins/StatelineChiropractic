            <h5>The Problem: Sublaxations</h5>
            <p>
              Subluxations occur when one or more of your vertebrae shift out of optimal position, causing them to
              be too rigid (or not rigid enough), putting pressure on your spinal nerves, straining your muscles, and
              potentially damaging the soft tissue in surrounding areas.  This can cause pain, decreased range of
              motion in multiple areas of the body, and an overall decrease in health and wellness.
            </p>
            <p>
              Trauma to our bodies in the form of disease, physical accidents, and even normal life experiences, like pregnancy,
              moving to a new home, or starting a new job can all cause subluxations.  When your body is healthy and
              functioning at 100%, you feel well, are pain free, and have a better quality of life.  Removing
              subluxations will help you to experience a higher level of health and wellness.

            <h5>The Solution: The Pro Adjuster</h5>
            <p>
              During a manual chiropractic adjustment, a Doctor of Chiropractic uses his/her sense of touch to detect
              and correct subluxations.  The Pro Adjuster uses advanced technology to do the same things, providing a
              gentle approach that is appropriate for everyone from infants to seniors.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many people who have been fearful of experiencing a traditional manual adjustment, mostly because
              they donâ€™t know what to expect, have found the Pro Adjuster to be a wonderful solution for
              eliminating subluxations in a way that makes them feel secure and comfortable.

            <h5>The Experience: What Does the Pro Adjuster Feel Like?</h5>
            <p>
              While you sit in a special chair, one of our Doctors of Chiropractic moves a small, U-shaped instrument
              down your spine, touching each vertebra and allowing the Pro Adjuster to detect areas of misalignment.
              After that, the doctor holds the instrument on the problem vertebra and the machine uses a series of
              gentle taps to shift the vertebra back into optimal position.  There are no sudden movements associated
              with this type of adjustment.  After this, the doctor many use the Pro Adjuster on other joints, like your
              shoulder or jaw, using the same tapping method as before.
