# [Stateline Chiropractic Clinic](http://statelinechiropracticclinic.com/#/)

This website was created for a client that wanted a simple site for their Chiropractic business. I used [MaterializeCSS](http://materializecss.com/) for the layout and CSS.

The site has some Angular sprinkled throughout, but by and large this is just a static website. 
## Amazon S3
I took this opportunity to learn more about static-site hosting on AmazonS3. For static sites, AmazonS3 is a HUGE win. The whole site is hosted in an S3 bucket and served for pennies on the dollar per month. The clients are incredibly happy with the result!
