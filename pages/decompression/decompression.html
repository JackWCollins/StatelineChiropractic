            Spinal decompression therapy is a leading non-surgical alternative for disc related syndromes of
            the lumbar and cervical spine.

          <p>
            Spinal discs have been shown to be a predominate site of pain, so
            treating it as directly as possible makes sense.  The blending of focused traction to the site,
            rehabilitation to the supporting structures, and overall strengthening of global musculature makes the
            treatment unique.  Spinal decompression therapy affects the disc as directly possible without surgery.
            Most patients feel significant pain reduction in as few as five spinal decompression therapy treatments.
