            The doctors of Stateline Chiropractic are able to fit you with custom functional orthotics by Foot
            Levelers. Functional Orthotics were designed by a chiropractor to treat the body as a functional unit and
            give you the support you need.
          </p>
          <p>
            They support the 26 bones and over 100 muscles in each of your feet to
            protect your foundation.  You can maintain your feet’s 3-arched structure, the plantar vault, to balance
            the entire body with Foot Levelers orthotics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Functional Orthotics are the solution for many ailments. Even if your feet don’t hurt, they may be
            contributing to overall postural imbalance.  If pain or discomfort occurs in a specific area of the body-
            anywhere from your feet to your neck- individually designed functional orthotics may help bring long-
            term relief.
